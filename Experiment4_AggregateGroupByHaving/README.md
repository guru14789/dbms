# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause
## Name: SREEKUMAR S
## Reg no: 212223240157
## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```
### Queries:

**Question 1**
--
What is the total number of appointments scheduled by each doctor?

Sample table:Appointments Table

```sql
SELECT DoctorID, COUNT(*) as TotalAppointments
FROM Appointments
GROUP BY DoctorID;
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
How many patients are covered by each insurance company?

Sample table:Insurance Table

name               type
-----------------  ----------
InsuranceID        INTEGER
PatientID          INTEGER
InsuranceCompany   TEXT
PolicyNumber       TEXT
PolicyHolder       TEXT
ValidityPeriod     TEXT

```sql
SELECT insuranceCompany, COUNT(DISTINCT PatientID) as TotalPatients 
FROM Insurance
GROUP BY InsuranceCompany;
```

**Output:**

FROM customer
WHERE city='Mumbai';
```

----------  ----------
id          INTEGER
name        TEXT
age         INTEGER
city        TEXT
income      INTEGER

```sql
SELECT MAX(age)-MIN(age) as age_difference
FROM employee;
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query that counts the number of unique salespeople. Return number of salespeople.

Sample table: orders

ord_no      purch_amt   ord_date    customer_id  salesman_id

----------  ----------  ----------  -----------  -----------

70001       150.5       2012-10-05  3005         5002

70009       270.65      2012-09-10  3001         5005

70002       65.26       2012-10-05  3002         5001

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salesman_id) as COUNT
FROM orders;
```

**Output:**

**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query to find the average length of email addresses (in characters):

Table: customer

name        type
----------  ----------
id          INTEGER
name        TEXT
city        TEXT
