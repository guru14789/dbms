# Experiment 3: DML Commands
## Name: SREEKUMAR S
## Reg no: 212223240157
## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### Queries:
**Question 1**
--
Update the total selling price to quantity sold multiplied by updated selling price per unit where product id is 10 in the sales table.

SALES TABLE
name               type
-----------------  ---------------
sale_id            INT
sale_date          DATE
product_id         INT
quantity           INT
sell_price         DECIMAL(10,2)
total_sell_price   DECIMAL(10,2)

```sql
update sales
set total_sell_price = quantity * sell_price
where product_id = 10
```

**Output:**

supplier_id    INT

```sql
update products
set category = 'Household'
where product_name like '%Detergent%';
```

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL statement to double the availability of the product with product_id 1.

products table

---------------
product_id
product_name
category_id
availability

```sql
update products
set availability = availability * 2
where product_id is 1;
```

**Output:**

**Question 4**
---
Decrease the reorder level by 30 percent where the product name contains 'cream' and quantity in stock is higher than reorder level in the products table.

PRODUCTS TABLE

name               type
-----------------  ---------------
product_id         INT
product_name       VARCHAR(100)
category           VARCHAR(50)
cost_price         DECIMAL(10,2)
sell_price         DECIMAL(10,2)
reorder_lvl        INT
quantity           INT
supplier_id        INT

```sql
update products
set reorder_lvl = reorder_lvl * 0.7
where product_name like '%cream%' and quantity > reorder_lvl;
```

**Output:**
